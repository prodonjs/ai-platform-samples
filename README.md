[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Welcome to the [AI Platform](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/) sample code repository. This repository contains samples for how to use AI Platform products.

## Overview

The repository is organized by products: 

 - [AI Platform Training](training)
 - [AI Platform Prediction](prediction)
 - [AI Platform Notebooks](notebooks)
 
<!--
 Commenting these out until we have at least a sample for them in the repo:
 - [Deep Learning VM Images](dlvm)
 - [Data Label Services](https://cloud.google.com/data-labeling/docs/)
 - [Built-in Algorithms](built_in_algorithms)
 -->

## Getting Started

We highly recommend that you start with our [Quick Start Sample](./quickstart).

## Navigating this Repository

This repository is organized based on the available products on AI Platform, and the typical Machine Learning problems 
that developers are trying to solve. For instance, if you are trying to train a model with [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org), 
you will find the sample under [training/sklearn/structured/base](./training/sklearn/structured/base) directory.
AI Platform also supports [xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org), and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

Please refer to the `README` file in each sample directory for more specific instructions.
